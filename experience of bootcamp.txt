#experience of bootcamp
This was an amazing experience as this was a combination of technical as well as spiritual knowledge. Both technical and spiritual parts were very helpful.<\br>
Firstly I would like to tell about the technical part, so it was a lot more than what I excepted before starting of this camp.
It introduced us with pyhon which is one of the most important programming language. 
It was also very helpful for developing the basic knowledge of machine learning. Now it is easier for us to explore more deeply about machine learning by ourself. 
Also the assignments and programming contest were amazing. It helped us to track our progress and also provided a competitive environment for better learning.  
This technical part of bootcamp was overall very helpfull for delevoping technical skills and making us aware of the concepts of machine learning.<br>
And coming on the more interesting part the evening sessions, interesting because spiritual knowlegde is something which can be helpful in any phase of life. specially 
in our college life if we are connected to spirituality and we remains away from bad habits such as drinking, smoking etc. It also helps us to be more concentrated towards 
are goal and help us to improve are acadmics.<br>
I really liked the session of art of smart work. All the things which are told in the session were important not only for managing acadmics but also later on in our life. 
So my overall experience of this bootcamp was excellent. I would like to join such camps in future also.<br>
I feel very blessed to be connected with the Bhakti Vedanta Club.
