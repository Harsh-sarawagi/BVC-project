# BVC-project
Some points about evening sessions:<br>
It provided a way to stay connected with spritual knowledge.<br>
Lectures of various alumini helped us to get their point of view about different problems.<br>
I liked the topics which are covered  such as art of smartwork, how to manage time efficiently, happiness simplified etc.<br>
I also liked that not only they just told us all things but also how we can impliment these teachings in our daily life.<br>
It was the best ways to keep ourself motivated during vacation time.<br>
These sessions will also help us to give a boost start to our upcoming semester.<br>
