# BVC-project
Some points about evening sessions:
It provided a way to stay connected with spritual knowledge.
Lectures of various alumini helped us to get their point of view about different problems.
I liked the topics which are covered  such as art of smartwork, how to manage time efficiently, happiness simplified etc.
I also liked that not only they just told us all things but also how we can impliment these teachings in our daily life.
It was the best ways to keep ourself motivated during vacation time.
These sessions will also help us to give a boost start to our upcoming semester.
